                    <p>
                        Cats are one of the best things to grace the Earth. They
                        are masterful predators, and they strike a mesmerizing
                        balance between power and beauty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The cat in the image isn't mine, but I do have a
                        (seemingly) Nebelung cat. She is very pretty, and she
                        does silly things like waking me up with biscuits at
                        3AM.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, at the bottom, you can go to 'Projects' to see
                        live demos for a few of my projects. You can also find
                        other projects I've worked on in GitHub.

                        fixedly at my face, seeming so choked with emotion, his
                        heart so full of feeling, that he could not say a thing
                        in reply.”
